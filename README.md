# CodeForGood_ArtLink-


This is a project I developed together with my team for JP Morgan's CodeForGood hackathon.
It's a social-platform website for carers of people with Autism, where they meet other carers, ask for help and
search for information on various topics around people with Autism and discuss them with others.
